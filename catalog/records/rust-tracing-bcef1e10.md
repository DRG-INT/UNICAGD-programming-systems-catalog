## System Engineer Summary

Application-level tracing for Rust.

## Operational Role

For a systems engineer, tracing belongs in the Rust inventory as part of hot-path discovery,
allocation analysis, latency control, and capacity planning.

## Release Intelligence

| Channel | Status | Version | Date | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stable | known | 0.1.44 | 2025-12-18T14:26:12.360139Z | [https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=1&per_page=100&sort=downloads](https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=1&per_page=100&sort=downloads) |  |
| preview/nightly | unknown |  |  | unknown | crates_io_has_no_standard_nightly_channel |

## Engineering Notes

- Treat category as `profiler` unless a later verified source gives a better classification.
- Keep provenance attached when merging duplicate identities; source evidence is not disposable.
- Latest stable metadata was observed from `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=1&per_page=100&sort=downloads` at `2026-09-01T01:59:15+00:00`.
- Preview/nightly metadata is unknown because `crates_io_has_no_standard_nightly_channel`.

## Provenance

| Kind | Status | Date | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| crates_io | registry-derived | 2026-09-01 | `{"kind": "crates_io", "retrieved": "2026-09-01", "status": "registry-derived"}` |

## Evidence
