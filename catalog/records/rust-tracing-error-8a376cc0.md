## Engineering Notes

- Treat category as `profiler` unless a later verified source gives a better classification.
- Keep provenance attached when merging duplicate identities; source evidence is not disposable.
- Latest stable metadata was observed from `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=12&per_page=100&sort=downloads` at `2026-09-01T02:12:58+00:00`.
- Preview/nightly metadata is unknown because `crates_io_has_no_standard_nightly_channel`.
