## System Engineer Summary

A tool for enlisting the compiler's help in proving the absence of concurrency

## Operational Role

For a systems engineer, sync_wrapper belongs in the Rust inventory as part of compiler selection,
diagnostics behavior, target support, ABI expectations, and build reproducibility.

## Release Intelligence

| Channel | Status | Version | Date | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stable | known | 1.0.2 | 2024-11-20T16:29:59.416129Z | [https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=2&per_page=100&sort=downloads](https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=2&per_page=100&sort=downloads) |  |
| preview/nightly | unknown |  |  | unknown | crates_io_has_no_standard_nightly_channel |

## Engineering Notes

- Treat category as `compiler` unless a later verified source gives a better classification.
- Keep provenance attached when merging duplicate identities; source evidence is not disposable.
- Latest stable metadata was observed from `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=2&per_page=100&sort=downloads` at `2026-09-01T01:59:15+00:00`.
- Preview/nightly metadata is unknown because `crates_io_has_no_standard_nightly_channel`.

## Provenance
